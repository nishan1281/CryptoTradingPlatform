<h2>C++ to build a Crypto Trading Platform </h2>

Coursera: This course is the fifth of five courses aiming to help you to become confident working in the object-oriented paradigm in the C++ language.
This specialisation is for individuals who want to learn about objected oriented programming. It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of C++, all the way to building a crypto-currency exchange platform.
During the five courses, you will work with the instructor on a single project: a crypto-currency exchange platform. Whilst building the project, you will learn about a range of programming techniques from basic control flow and input/output through to file parsing, object-oriented techniques and user interaction on the console.
In this fifth course, you will complete the crypto-currency exchange platform. You will learn about modelling real-world entities as a class, the use of static vs non-static functions, and create a wallet class for the final version of the crypto application.
Upon completing the course, you will be able to:
Use object interactions to achieve complex functionality through a simple command sequence
Explain how to model a familiar real world entity as a class with data and functions
Decide when it is appropriate to use static or non-static functions

<h2>Steps used to configure github </h2>

1	Created a project in local folder						
2	Made a repository in git with same name of project folder						
3	Navigate to your project folder and initialize a Git repository:					#	git init </code>
4	now configure this user for this repository:						# git config user.email "user mail address"
5	Add the remote repository: 						# git remote add origin <repository_URL>
6	Rename the default branch from 'master' to 'main':						# git branch -m master main
7	Create a new branch named 'main' and switch to it:						# git checkout -b main
8	Pull changes from the remote repository to the 'main' branch:						# git pull origin main
9	Stage all changes:						# git add .
10	Commit changes:						# git commit -m "Initial commit"
11	Push changes to the 'main' branch:						# git push -u origin main
